Topics: Multi-branch if
		If statement without curly braces
		Nested if

Single if: for one condition

If & Else: when there are TWO (not more, not less than 2) options/possibilities/alternatives we need to create condition for

            for 2 conditions


Multi branch If: when there are three more options/possibilities/alternatives we need to create condition for

            for three or more conditions

        if(Condition1){
            StatementA
        }else if(Condition2){
            StatementB
        }else if(Condition3){
            StatementC
        }else{
            StatementD
        }


        ONLY one block gets executed

        StatementA: Condition1 is true

        StatementB: Condition1 MUST be false, Conidtion2 is true

        StatementC: Condition1 & Condition2 MUST be false, contion3 is true

        StatementD: Condition1 & Condition2 & Condition3 must be false



If statement without curly braces:
            without the curly braces the blocks of if statement can only have one statement in its body
