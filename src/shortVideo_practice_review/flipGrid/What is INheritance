What is inheritance?

---> Inheritance has the same definition and the English language as in Java.

    ---> It is one of the most important pillars in OOP(Object Oriented Programming).

    ---> Inheritance is a structure used in Java that permits us to acquire characteristics
            (fields, and methods) of another class by using the extends keyword.

        ---> Benefit:

                    -> Reusability : when create a new class and an existing class
                                     has some features that we want, we can derive the new class
                                     from the existing one.

                    -> Now Method Overriding is also known as runtime polymorphism. We can
                        achieve Polymorphism in Java with the help of inheritance.


             -> For example:
                --> If we have an employee class and we
                    want to create classes for the types of employees like
                    tester and developers.

                    -> They all have some common features like:
                                                    -> Employee name
                                                    -> Job title
                                                    -> Gender
                                                    -> Age

                    --> Instead of writing the code for these over and over again...
                            we can write the code 1 time in the Super class and extend
                                    it i as many classes as we need.
