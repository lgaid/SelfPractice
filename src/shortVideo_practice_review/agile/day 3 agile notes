    - Scrum artifact: Product Backlog
                      Sprint Backlog
                      Product Increment

    - Scrum meetings: Grooming
                      Sprint Planning
                      Daily stand up
                      Demo

=====================================
Key words
User Story: the short requirement
            PO writes US

            format:
            As a <user type> I want to <function> so that <business value>

Acceptance Criteria: more detail info about a story
                     PO writes ACs

           As a student, I want to view Calendar page.

            AC1: student should see a calendar module under the Topics module on the homepge.
            AC2: there should be calendar icon before the module name
            AC3: once a user ciclk the module name, they should be on the Calendar page
                  URL: https://my.cydeo.com/account/calendar
            AC4: there should be a seperate DB table for this module

==================================
Product Backlog : has list of user tories/tasks to work soon

========================
Environments:

Dev env : dev.google.com
QA env : qa.google.com
stg env : stg.google.com
production env: google.com


=========================
Product Increment : compelted / done user stories from a sprint

            ex: sprin5: planned to complete 10 user stories
                        actually complted 7 user stories -> these are called product increment

                        3 incompeleted user stories will be done next sprint
---------------------------
Fibonacci squence number:

      1 2 3 5 8 13 21

   1 point ==  1 day effort

   1 point = super easy user story
   2 points == takes half day effort


   EX: As a user, i want to login.

    Dev1: 3 points == 3 days to complete
    Dev2: 8 points == 8 days to complete
    Dev3: 3 points == 3 days to complete
    Dev4: 5 points == 5 days to complete

         PO asks the reseason from the dev who gave the hightes point & lowest point
          after negotiate, they will decide one point to the story => 3 points

Why only estimate from 1 to 21?
 - 1 sprint max can be 20 days / 4 weeks. there are only 18 days are avaliable for working on user stories. so 21 is the max we assign a story.
 - alos 1 user story should be small enough to be completed within a sprint!

 1 sprint == 1 week  = 3 days to work on user stories (1st and last days are full of meeting)
 1 sprint == 2 weeks = 8 days to work on user stories (1st and last days are full of meeting)
 1 sprint == 3 weeks = 13 days to work on user stories (1st and last days are full of meeting)
 1 sprint == 4 weeks = 18 days to work on user stories (1st and last days are full of meeting)

==========================


 Daiana : 3 points
 Yusuf  : 1 point
 Yasin  : 8 points
 Sumeyye: 3 points

 PO: ask from Yusuf and Yasin to explain their reseaons?

      - after discusstion, devs will estimate for the 2nd time

        Daiana : 3 points
 		Yusuf  : 3 point
 		Yasin  : 5 points
 		Sumeyye: 3 points

   PO : 3 points

     As a user, I want to create a module.    5 points
        subtaks: UI
                 DB
                 API

     As a user, I want to edit a module.      1 point
     As a user, I want to delete a module.    2 points

      As a user, I want to delete a module_ui.
      As a user, I want to delete a module_db.
      As a user, I want to delete a module_api.

================

Grooming: before the meeting: PO prepare user stories
          during the meeting:

           1. PO expalins the user stories
           2. Dev ask question  -PO answer
           3. Estimation based on the Fibonacci system 1 2 3 5 8 13 21

           2 - 4 hours of meeting :  1 - 4 weeks cycle sprint

Sprint planning meeting:



   Devs:
   	Alena : 10 days - 2 days meeting = 8 days for the user stories
   	Umran : 10 days - 2 days meeting = 8 days for the user stories
   	Ahmed : 10 days - 2 days meeting = 8 days for the user stories
   QA:
    Muhtar: 10 days - 2 days meeting = 8 days for the user stories

         Team capacity:  total work avaliability == 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 32


  SM asks a question: any one has any day off?

      - Each developer and QA answer teh question

    Sprint 64:
      Alena - no
      Umran - no
      Ahmed - 1 day off
      Muhtar - no

      team capacity = 31
===========================

Definition of ready : DOR

   - condition to see if a user story ready to be taken from the PB to the SB

   EX DOR:

     1. PO explained the story?
     2. Does that story has at least 1 AC?
     3. Does the design provided?
     4. Each dev & QA understood the story?
     5. Is it estimated?
     6. is this story small? small enought to complete in one sprint



=====================================

 Epic: big user story
       any story takes more then 1 sprint to complete
       Epic needs to break down to small several user stories
       PO do this


       ex: 2 weeks sprint: 8 days to work on user story

            user story: 1 2 3 5 (8)
            Epic: 13 21

           3 weeks = 13 days to work stories
             user story: 1 2 3 5 8 (13)
             Epic : 21


           1 week : 3 days to work on stories
              user story: 1 2 3
              Epic: 5 8 13 21



  As a user, I want to work on the courses. --> 21 days to complete == 21 points

      As a user, I want to delete a courses_ui.   5 points
      As a user, I want to delete a courses_db.   3 points
      As a user, I want to delete a courses_api.  1 points

      As a user, I want to edit a courses_UI.      2 points
      As a user, I want to edit a courses_DB.      1 points
      As a user, I want to edit a courses_API.     1 points

      As a user, I want to create a courses_UI.     3 points
      As a user, I want to create a courses_DB.     2 points
      As a user, I want to create a courses_API.    5 points


-----------------

As a user . i want to login -> 13 points during the grooming meeting -> Epic

PO will break it down to small several user stories after the meeting, make them ready for the next sprint's grooming.

   As a user . i want to see the login title - Cydeo/login
   As a user . i want to go to login page - URL

===============================

Sprint planning meeting:

   atendee: Scrum team

      1. SM creates a Sprint backlog on Jira
      2. SM help the team to calculate the team capacity
            team capacity : total work avalibility of dev & qa in a sprint
