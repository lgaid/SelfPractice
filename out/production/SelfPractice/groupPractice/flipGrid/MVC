Question: Please explain the MVC flow in Spring Boot and mention about how
you implemented MVC structure in your project (Ticketing)

---> MVC is an architectural pattern consisting of three parts:
     --> Model, View, Controller.
            ->  Model: Handles data logic.
            ->  View: Displays the information from the MODEL to the USER.
            ->  Controller: Controls the data flow into a MODEL OBJECT and UPDATES the VIEW whenever data changes.

So Model is an interface name, which we used in the parameters of the controller methods to be able to send live data
from our application to the views. And we do this by using some methods of the Model for example .addAttribute().
