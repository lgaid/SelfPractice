Question 9: What's Polymorphism? What's down-casting and upcasting?
Duration: 3 min

Polymorphism is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP)
            ---> allows us to execute the same action in many different forms.

For example:
                ---> The print() method is also an example of polymorphism.
                           because It is used to print values of different types like char , int , string , etc.

2 types of poly: Static and Dynamic
                => Static poly is resolved at compile time. Example: Method overloading
                => Dynamic poly the process in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at
                   at runtime.

================================

    --->In java Polymorphism allows us to transform our data type up or down the hierarchy chain
            through Typecasting which helps take advantage of polymorphism.


Typecasting is the process of converting 1 data type to another.
There 2 are types of casting:


Upcasting is Generalization Widening---
        --> it's casting individual type(parent type) to 1 common type.
                --> This can be done implicitly/explicitly
                    --> In Java it's hardly used. It is used to dev a code
                        that only deals with parent class.
                        ---> All Java objects are polymorphic and can be treated
                                as objects of supertype due to upcasting


Downcasting is Specialization or narrowing---
        --> it's casting common type(child type) to individual type
            --> This can ONLY be done explicitly
                --> We use Downcasting to dev a code that accesses the functions
                    of child class.
                   -->  To downcast an object safely, we need instanceof operator.
                            If the real object doesn't match the type we downcast to,
                                    then ClassCastException will be thrown at runtime.

We apply casting through parenthesis...

For example: If we want to store a long value in a simple integer then we can cast
               long to int by putting the type name inside the parentheses then the expression outside of it.
