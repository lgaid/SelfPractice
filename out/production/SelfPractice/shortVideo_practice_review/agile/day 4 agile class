 DO YOU KNOW AGILE - SCRUM

 I have experience working in the Agile-Scrum environment, which describes a set of meetings, tools, and roles that
 work in concert to help teams structure and manage their work.

   IN MY TEAM:

    # We implemented 2 weeks sprint cycle
    # I have a total of {number} people in my team - ** 1 PO, 1SM, {number} developers, and {number} QAs **


 DURING THE SPRINT, WE CONDUCTED ALL THE SCRUM CEREMONIES/MEETINGS: **

     # GROOMING meeting starts on the first day of each sprint; all the Scrum members join
        --> The PO EXPLAINS the US to the dev team, and we ESTIMATE POINTS based on FIBONACCI. ***

     # SPRINT PLANNING meeting comes after, to IDENTIFY the SPRING GOAL with the exact tasks/US.
        --> We pull/choose US/tasks FROM PB TO THE SB based on our TEAM CAPACITY AND DOR CRITERIA.

     # Every morning at {time} we conduct a DAILY STAND-UP meeting to UPDATE OUR TASK STATUS by answering three
          [questions].
        --> The burn-down chart helps us predict when all the work will be completed.

     # Last day of the sprint, we have the DEMO meeting with the client to present our completed works.
          The PO accepts/rejects the works based on our team's DOD criteria. All the accepted works are the PRODUCT
          INCREMENT, and any uncompleted/rejected work will be back to the PB, and we will go over them at the next
          Grooming meeting.

     # We conduct RETRO meeting with the SM and QAs; this meeting helps us to find our dev team to create improvement
          opportunities. We inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, and
          tools by answering three questions - {Qs}
