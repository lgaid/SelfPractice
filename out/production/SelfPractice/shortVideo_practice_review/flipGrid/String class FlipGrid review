Flipgrid Q4: What String is in Java? How do we create it? Why is it immutable?
String is a class that comes from:
          - JRE system library
          - implicitly imported by java.lang.String package
           -when creating string objects are instances of the String Class

In Java String
    - constitutes sequences of characters

String is the Most special class in Java
    Why?
    - ONLY String Class offers 2 options to create objects from ...
    - all other classes must use new keyword at all times
How do we create it? there are 2 way:

            1.    using String Literals ("") which becomes String literal object
                        -located in special memory called the String Pool(inside the Heap)
            2.    using new keyword
                        - creates different new object each time it's used
                        - located in the Heap memory
String is also immutable:
                - Major reason security
                - for network connections, credentials, database connections,caching, etc
Therefore, String is one of the most important classes in Java
